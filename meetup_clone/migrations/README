# Migrations Directory

This directory contains migration scripts for the database schema. These scripts are generated and managed by Flask-Migrate, which is an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to keep track of changes to the database schema over time. Each migration script represents a set of changes to the schema, such as adding or removing columns, creating or dropping tables, etc.

## Usage

To create a new migration script, use the following command:

```bash
flask db migrate -m "Description of the migration"
```

To apply the migration to the database, use the following command:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

To revert the migration, use the following command:

```bash
flask db downgrade
```

## Important Files

- `env.py`: This file sets up the migration environment and configures Alembic to use the Flask app's database settings.
- `script.py.mako`: This is the template file used by Alembic to generate new migration scripts.
- `versions/`: This directory contains the actual migration scripts, each named with a unique identifier and a description of the migration.
